this site does time estimation

http://www.cotrip.org/speed.htm


There doesn't seem to be a historical set of travel times readily available.... so probably have to scrape it.

The following are data links which build the cotrip.org interface:

var ROUTES_URL = "/speed/getRoutes.do";
var SLOWDOWNS_URL = "/speed/getSlowDowns.do";
var SEGMENTS_URL = "/speed/getSegments.do";
var GET_SEGMENT_POLYLINE_URL = "/speed/getSegmentPolyline.do";
var GET_ROUTE_POLYLINE_URL = "/speed/getRoutePolyline.do";

#the website polls every 2 minutes... probably only need 5 minute increments.

If it polls every 2 minutes, it means they don't really ahve a rate limit...should be able to scrape continuously forever.
